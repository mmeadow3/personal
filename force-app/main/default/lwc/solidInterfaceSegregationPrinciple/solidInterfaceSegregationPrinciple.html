        The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. 
        <br>
        In Apex, this means breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

        This is mainly a problem when you have multiple developers who are changing code.  So a dev might change a method on a class and another developer now can no longer compile their class because of this.
