        Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass).
        <br>        
        In Salesforce Apex, inheritance enables developers to create efficient, reusable code by defining common functionality in a parent class and extending or customizing it in child classes.

        it is generally recommended to avoid inheritance in Lightning Web Components (LWC) in favor of composition.
        <br>        
        This approach aligns with modern JavaScript and web development best practices, which prefer composition over inheritance to achieve more flexible, maintainable, and reusable code.
        <hr>
        Inheritance can lead to tight coupling and reduced flexibility, which is why itâ€™s discouraged in Lightning Web Components.
        <br>  
        Composition is the recommended approach, allowing for loose coupling, easier testing, and greater flexibility in how components are assembled and reused.
        <br>  
        Composition aligns with modern web development best practices and makes your LWC components more maintainable and modular.
