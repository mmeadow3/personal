        The Observer design pattern is a behavioral pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects. 
        <br>
        It allows an object (the Subject) to maintain a list of its dependents (Observers) and notify them automatically of any state changes.        
        <br>
        The Observer design pattern works as a communication channel between the Subject and its Observers, allowing them to stay up-to-date with the Subject’s state without having direct knowledge of each other’s internal details.
